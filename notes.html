	MAKING A DIFFERENCE
	ONE NIGHT'S SLEEP AT A TIME
	Because of people like you, we're able to provide children with beds of their own so they can sleep better and grow up healthier.
	
		
	Hope To Dream believes that every child should have a good night's sleep and a bed to call their own. For over 10 years, Ashley HomeStores has donated a portion of the mattress sales to Hope to Dream to provide children with twin mattresses, bed frame, bedding and pillow. Our efforts have helped over 125,000 kids improve their sleeping conditions, leading to a higher quality of life.
	
	
	
	make a difference to a child's life
	
	Thousands of children in North America who live in poverty do not have a bed of their own. Hope to Dream bwlieves that every child should have their own bed for a better night's sleep. Your 100% tax deductible gift helps Hope to Dream provide beds to children in need. Less than 3% of your donation goes to administrative costs.

about hope to dream

We believe that every child should have a safe and comfortable bed to call their own and that helping children sleep well sets them up to lead a healthier and more productive life. That's why since 2010, Ashley HomeStores has gifted over 125,000 underserved children with the beds they need for a better night's sleep.

By donating a portion of our mattress sales, we're able to provide a twin mattress, bed frame, bedding and pillow to a child who might otherwise go without and potentially suffer the negative and emotional effects of sleep deprivation.
